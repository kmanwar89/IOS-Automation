# IOS-Automation
provision.py - This is a helper program I wrote to help me generate a large number of basic template configurations for IOS devices. This is especially useful for programs like GNS3 or VIRL where I am configuring the same thing across lots of devices.

Placeholder options for Firewall, WLC and UCS are included in the code for future growth.
