# IOS-Automation
provision.py - This is a helper program I wrote to help me generate a large number of basic template configurations for IOS devices. This is especially useful for programs like GNS3 or VIRL where I am configuring the same thing across lots of devices.

At this time, the device prompts for firewall, WLC and UCS, but the syntax of the commands is not specific to those devices - it is written for routers & switches. Those placeholder options are included in the code for future growth.

I also intend to implement this in an object-oriented fashion using proper classes/functions in the near future.
